**Quote Generator using JavaScript and Heroku API**

This repository contains a simple yet elegant Quote Generator web application built using JavaScript and powered by the Heroku API. The application displays random inspirational quotes to uplift users' spirits and provide them with daily motivation.

**Features:**

- **Random Quotes:** Every time the user visits the page or clicks a "New Quote" button, a new random quote is fetched from the Heroku API. This ensures a fresh and exciting experience for users with each interaction.

- **Share on Twitter:** Users can easily share their favorite quotes with the world by clicking the "Tweet" button, which opens a new tweet window with the selected quote as a pre-filled tweet.

- **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

- **Minimalist UI:** The user interface is kept clean and minimalistic, focusing on the essence of the quotes and providing a distraction-free reading experience.

**Deployment:**

The application is hosted on Heroku, making it accessible to users on the web. The Heroku API is integrated into the JavaScript code to fetch random quotes from the server.

**How to Use:**

1. Simply visit the Quote Generator website.
2. A random quote will be displayed on the screen.
3. Click the "New Quote" button to fetch another random quote.
4. To share a quote on Twitter, click the "Tweet" button.

**Development:**

The Quote Generator is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The JavaScript fetches data from the Heroku API using HTTP requests and dynamically updates the HTML content to display the fetched quotes. The application's code is organized into separate files for easy maintenance and modularity.
